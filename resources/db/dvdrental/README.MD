Ignore everything in this folder except for possibly the .DAT files.  
I was trying to automate/script the loading of Postgres DB, but PostGres ke .DAT filespt fighting me on the data loading piece.  
So I just switched to using pgAdmin4 and doing a restore with the .DAT files in resources/db/dvdrental/data.
